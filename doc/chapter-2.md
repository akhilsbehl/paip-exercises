* ... the functions take no arguments. This is unusual because, strictly speaking, a function with no arguments would always return the same thing, so we would use a constant instead. However, these functions make use of the `random` function, and thus can return different results even with no arguments. Thus, they are not functions in the mathematical sense, but they are still called functions in Lisp, because they return a value.

* The special forms `defvar` and `defparameter` both introduce special variables and assign a value to them; the difference is that a variable, like `*grammar*`, is routinely changed during the course of running the program. A parameter, like `*simple-grammar*`, on the other hand, will stay constant. A change to a parameter is considered a change to the program, not a change by the program.
