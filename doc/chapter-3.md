* In summary, Common Lisp special variables are different because they have global scope but admit the possibility of local (dynamic) shadowing. Remember: A lexical variable has lexical scope and indefinite extent. A special variable has indefinite scope and dynamic extent. The function call `(symbol-value var)`, where var evaluates to a symbol, can be used to get at the current value of a special variable.

* Special variables set up a mapping between symbols and values that is accessible to the running program. This is unlike lexical variables (and all variables in traditional languages) where symbols (identifiers) have significance only while the program is being compiled. Once the program is running, the identifiers have been compiled away and cannot be used to access the variables; only code that appears within the scope of a lexical variable can reference the variable.
